# Skirmish at Crane Reach agent

Edit `agent.py` to build one unit's behavior for Skirmish at Crane Reach. Every unit on a side runs a separate instance of the same `Agent` class, so they do not share state or variables. `sandbox/[...]

Start with the [Getting Started guide](https://vox-deorum.github.io/game-sandbox/students/getting-started/). Then run these commands from this folder as you work:

```console
python -m sandbox play   # command a side yourself in your browser
python -m sandbox watch  # watch your agent take on Naive
python -m sandbox test   # run the provided checks
python -m sandbox eval   # compare your agent with Naive
```

**Naive** is a simple built-in opponent. It holds the other side in `watch` and `eval`, and `eval` reports your side's average score over repeatable matches. The [`environment.md`](environment.md)[...]

## Files you will use

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `agent.py` | Your `Agent` implementation and the first TODO locations. |
| `environment.md` | Crane rules, starter walkthrough, helpers, observations, and settings. |
| `manifest.json` | Names the agent class for a submission. |
| `season.json` | Optional local season settings downloaded from My Submissions. |
| `tests/` | Checks your submission should pass. |
| `sandbox/` | Local game, commands, helper package, and observation types. Do not edit it. |
| `requirements.txt` | Exact Python package versions used by the server. |
| `requirements-dev.txt` | Test dependencies. |
| `.env.example` | Example local LLM settings. |

The starter returns Crane orders with `action.move()` and `action.stay()` from `sandbox.crane`. Its `act(observation)` receives the current observation and action mask. Before changing the strateg[...]

Leave `sandbox/`, `requirements.in`, and `requirements.txt` unchanged. The pinned packages match the server. Ask your instructor before adding a package.

When your agent is ready, follow the shared [submitting guide](https://vox-deorum.github.io/game-sandbox/students/submitting/). For the optional `learn` and `chat` hooks, see the shared [agent int[...]

## Optional LLM API

If your instructor enables model calls, follow [Using the LLM API](llm.md). Copy `.env.example` to `.env`, add the endpoint and key, and never commit either secret.

Test the connection with:

```console
python -m sandbox llm
```

### Design Goal
My plan was to have the archers retreat while continue attacking and have the cavalry units expend their full movement.

### Reflection
Getting the NPCs to move randomly was difficult, as trying to input random strategies would make them lose against the AI more frequently. Average scores were in the 30s compared to 80s with the fixed stratagems

### AI disclosure
The built in AI assistant helped me determine strategies for each player character.
